## Development Stack

My currently preferred stack

```ruby
if (( MacOS and Nix ) or ( NixOS and Gnome ))
  and ( Fish and Git and Dotbot )
  and ( Ruby or Python or Node )
  and ( YAML or LibSQL or ( Postgres and PostgREST ))
  and ( SASS and Slim and CoffeeScript )
  "I'm a unicorn like you, let's chat!"
else
  "I can help you become a mythical creature like me, let's chat."
end
```
